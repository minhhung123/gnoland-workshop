A Realm is a Smart Contract on GnoLand. It is written in Gno, an interpreted version of Golang.

By convention, each realm can expose a `Render(path string) string` function to render in markdown the Realm state for a certain path.

In this challenge, you must write the Render function of the Solve realm to make the unit test in `solve_test.gno` succeed!
