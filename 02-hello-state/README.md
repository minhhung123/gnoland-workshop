In this challenge, you must write the Render function and state management of the Solve Realm to make the unit tests in `solve_test.gno` succeed. Those unit tests are executed sequentially from the top to bottom of the test file.

Use `gnodev test r/solve --verbose` to run the tests.

Do not modify the tests or the hello package.
